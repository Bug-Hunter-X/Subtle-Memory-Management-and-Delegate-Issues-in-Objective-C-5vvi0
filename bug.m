In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with objects that are not properly retained or released. This often manifests as unexpected crashes or erratic behavior, particularly when using `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  For instance:

```objectivec
// Incorrect memory management
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
// ... some operations ...
[myObject release]; //If myObject is retained elsewhere this will lead to problems 
// ... later use of myObject can lead to a crash 
```

Another subtle issue is related to `delegate` properties. If a delegate object is not properly retained, the object might be deallocated while it's still being used by the delegating object. This will usually result in a crash when trying to send a message to a deallocated object. Consider this example:

```objectivec
@property (assign) id <MyDelegate> delegate;
```

Using `assign` means that the delegate property does not retain its value and could lead to memory issues if not managed carefully.
