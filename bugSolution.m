To solve the memory management issue, ensure proper use of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Use `retain` when you need to keep a reference to the object, and `release` when you are finished with it.  For properties, use `strong` or `weak` appropriately instead of `assign`.  For delegates, always use `strong` or `weak` (depending on whether the delegator owns the delegate), ensuring a correct lifecycle relationship. Consider this corrected code:

```objectivec
// Correct memory management
MyObject *myObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
[myObject retain]; //if appropriate
// ... some operations ...
[myObject release]; //release only if ownership has been taken 
```

For the delegate issue, change the delegate property declaration to use `assign` or `weak`, depending on context: 

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyDelegate> delegate;
```
Using `weak` avoids retain cycles and ensures the delegate is not retained unnecessarily, preventing the deallocation issue. If the delegator is the owner of the delegate, then `strong` should be used instead of weak.
